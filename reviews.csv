5,"The ice bar Berlin has been my favorite stop on my vacation so far. The drinks are fantastic with very good prices, and Nora. The bartender was amazing. Lots of great spots for photos and a great atmosphere. It's a little cold though. #icebar #poppingbottlesintheicelikeablizzard"
5,Unique experience to drink beer or liquor in an ice glass or ice shot glass. 3 drinks for $20 are not bad at all. Go early so they are not jam packed. Service is friendly. Get glove and hat to enjoy the experience. Try them out. Get one drink outside while waiting for your turn and 2 drinks inside the ice bar for 30 minutes. Music is loud but upbeat
5,Very good experience. The staff was very nice and accommodating. I had a good time with friends and it was very interesting. Definitely recommend!!
5,"Everything about this place was top notch. 

To start you got these cute passport books for 3 drinks and then you were able to get your first drink before going into the ice bar. 

Then they brought you into the bar and explain the story behind it. I loved that they had an entire story and theme behind the bar. Only recommendation would be to include a free photo to take home as a memory instead of needing to buy one."
5,"Great time with friends! Awesome bartenders, fun time in Berlin! Good drinks and the staff   was very good to a be around. They made it worth it!"
5,"What a wonderful experience it was! 
We purchased the tickets online as we were told the line might be long. Line was not long at all but the place was packed. The ticket includes 3 drinks. The first one in the bar to get you started. 
The other two will be in the icebar.  They provided gloves. Hat and a coat. You need them. The place gets freakin cold after a drink.  The bartender, a French lady was so very nice and so friendly.  Thank you . You made our experience a memorable one !!!"
4,Always wanted to go and try an ice bar. It was a unique experience. The tickets were a great price. 3 drinks for 20€ is so good. There were plenty of groups of people when we went. Everyone was pleasant. Check it out :)

1,"Out of all the many, many IceBars I've been to, this one was, by far, the worst. The Ice bar was not even that cold and fluorescent lighting made it super unpleasant to hang in. Staff doing the presentation had zero heart in it. They were supposed to offer photos and didn't. Staff obvs hate their customers. We on Sat night 10/21 around 9pm. The Dungeon Tour next door was the same price but worth 20 x ice bar walkthroughs."
1,"An extremely rude tour guide and poor customer service really ruined this experience. This is a tourist trip where you don't get what you pay for, and leave feeling cheated and hollow. The ambulance is dirty and tacky, completely unlike their advertising- very dishonest"
